This directory contains the pieces for minimega.org's App Engine
website. If you're not one of the minimega.org owners, you may still
find this useful to check out how your changes to minidoc might look
when pushed.

Run "update-files.sh /path/to/minimega-root" to pull in the
appropriate files. The appcfg.py command it prints is only suitable if
you have push permissions for the minimega.org app engine
site. Otherwise, you can run "goapp serve" to run a local instance for
testing.
